# PrimeNumbers
Generate 1000 Prime Numbers beginning with 2. The server-side application is written in Node.js, and the Jade template engine. The client-side uses Bootstrap for a front-end framework and jQuery for event handling. The "Generate" button makes an AJAX call to an API that generates prime numbers and returns the values as a JSON array object.
